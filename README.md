# Scalper Project

## Authors:

Lee Thomas, Taylor Johnson, Alex Pena, Paul Leonard

## Overview:

The global pandemic is severely limiting the supply chain, and this has caused a massive rise to scalpers. Scalpers are people who buy a product with no intention of using it, only to turn around and sell the product online for double, triple, or quadruple its msrp. A scalpers goal is to take advantage of the products hype and limit of the supply chain for a quick profit. We will be using a web scraper to find the inflated prices of scalped products and graph them against the msrp. We will find historical data of similar scalped products and graph them as well. Then, we can compare the pre-covid scalping to todays scapling, amisdst a disrupted supply chain, and observe any differences.
